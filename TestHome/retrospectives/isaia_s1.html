<!-- ---------------------------- External Issues ----------------------------- -->

<b>CCP</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Testing was interrupted by the Corp Apply to Join Minitask which required 2 testers for a whole day.
		<li>A lot of testers are still lacking access to Aptest accounts.
		<ul>
			<li>Ongoing issue with CCP, there is very little movement on the accounts with the link to Lync.
			<li>Daniel was able to quickly make a new temporary account for this sprint. 
		</ul>
		<li>Stewart, Tormod and Iain do not have access to Lync accounts.
		<li>Several small unplanned downtimes due to server issues &#45; 1.25 hours per tester.
		<li>Particularly unstable build caused many interruptions to usual flow of sprint.
		<li>Many blocked scripts required some scripts to be revisited later in the sprint.
		<ul>
			<li>Incursions &#45; Dom Sov: Outposts &#45; Dom Sov: Starbases &#45; Outposts: Construction and Management &#45; CQ.
		</ul>
		<li>Incursions had to be ran without access to certain GM tool which caused large delays. 
		<li>Hidden JIRA issues meant that time was lost investigating issues already in JIRA.
		<li>Lack of Confluence access continues to damage flow of info from PTW to CCP.
		<li>Benn Green could not see Lync messages being sent by the PTW team during a task.
	</ul></p>

<b> PTW </b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Stefan was required on another project and missed several days of the sprint. 
		<li>Iain was required to backfill the Valkyrie team for 3 days.
		<li>Testers used sprint time to complete KPI self-assessments and the Employee Satisfaction Survey which slowed down testing.
		<ul>
			<li>It is unclear whether these should be completed during sprint time or in the testers own time.
		</ul>
		<li>New Skype poses a lot of problems which slows down testing.
		<ul>
			<li>Very heavy system load &#45; can effect performance of slower computers.	
			<li>Switching chat channels can take a very long time.
			<li>A lot less clear
			<ul>
				<li>Day divisions are incorrect
				<li>A lot less text in the same amount of space &#45; things move out of view much quicker.
			</ul>
			<li>Drew finds it much harder to read due to coloured background.
		</ul>
	</ul></p>

<!-- ---------------------------- Good Practices ----------------------------- -->

<b>Sprint</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The team dealt very well with a large amount of blocked scripts and having to revisit scripts later in the sprint.
		<li>The team did well to report our blocked scripts.
		<ul>
			<li>Dave Mitchell was able to prioritize the fixing of the blocking defects.
		</ul>
		<li>Finished early despite minitask interruptions and downtime.  
		<li>The team did well to team up and manually run Incursions together.
		<li>FW scripts and tracker continue to save the team large amounts of time.
		<li>FW scripts were ran immediately after the sprint in preparation for next sprint.  
	</ul></p>
	
<b>Communication</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Great general team communication.
		<ul>
			<li>All testers help each other with troubleshooting and discussing issues.
			<li>Knowledge sharing among testers is excellent.
		</ul>
		<li>Positive relationship with the CCP QA continues to grow.
		<li>Good use of Lync for minitask group chats with the CCP QA.
		<li>Good use of team calendar.
		<ul>
			<li>Stewart was able to easily pick up Stefan&#39;s scripts using the calendar.
		</ul>
	</ul></p>

<b>Documents and Practices</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Good use of new best practice for questions in Skype.
		<li>Good use of old minitask documents when investigating functionality.
		<li>Best practice established for sharing large patches using the office SSD (NAS).
		<li>There has been an increase in reporting during the day which helps whoever is writing the DSR.
	</ul></p>
	
<b>Software and Testing tools</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The team did well to adapt to new Skype.
		<ul>
			<li>Using bold and /me to help draw attention to important information and announcements.
		</ul>
		<li>The team gained access to a new JIRA project which allows us to now view certain issues which were hidden before.
		<li>The team coped well with the lack of Aptest accounts.
	</ul></p>

<div class="expandable_content_header">Internal Issues</div>
</a>
<div id="team_concerns" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Inernal Issues----------------------------- -->
<b> General </b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The team&#39;s Outlook calendar is behaving oddly, some people are not getting notifications.
		<li>The team feel that having standups late in the morning disrupt flow and make it harder for the Scrum Master to gather accurate statistics.
		<li>The team feels they are lacking a properly recorded and accessible guide to all slash commands.
		<li>Questions being asked in Skype were occasionally missing information and testers had not performed basic checks before posting.
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Best practice was established during sprint and is as follows:
	</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Before posting:
		</ul>
				<ul>		
					<li>Check documents (change req, Q+A).
					<li>Check Script Tips.
					<li>Clear cache.
					<li>Check Multiplicity.
					<li>Search JIRA.
					<li>Update drivers if it is an audio or graphics issue.
				</ul>
		<ul>
		<br>
			<li>When posting:
		</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Be clear.
					<li>Use bold.
					<li>Link testcase.
				</ul>
	</ul></p>

	
<b>Documentation</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Team needs to use the QA doc, Test Home and other resourced more.
		<li>Inserting rows in the rep doc must be done correctly.
		<li>Personal pages in the sprint tracker must not be edited.
	</ul></p>

<div class="expandable_content_header">Action Points</div>
</a>
<div id="action_points" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Action Points ----------------------------- -->

<b>CCP</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Tormod will create a clear list who is on which team and which role each team is currently working on what.
		<li>Confluence access will be pushed for.
		<li>Testrail Demo&#39;s during exploratory.
		<li>Lync and Aptest accounts for Backfill
	</ul></p>

<b>Sprint</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>When taking over another testers script mid sprint, the new tester should be listed as supporting tester.
		<li>When using aptest, a defect entered against a test step should be entered in the notes as well as the defectID section.
	</ul></p>
	
<b>Documents and Practices</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>A shared space will be created for the FW and Outposts trackers for each sprint, to make it easier for testers to take over those scripts if necessary.
		<li>If preparing the DSR for the day, the reporter should check the personal pages on the tracker to make sure it is correct.
		<li>If a script has been started by another tester and is being taken over by you, you should be listed as supporting tester.
		<li>Test Home should be updated
		<li>The documentation folder should be tidied up.
		<li>All backfill testers should be made clear on these changes.
		<li>When experiencing difficulties with Skype, clearing the cache may resolve the issue, though this should only be done when absolutely necessary as keeping a log is important.
	</ul></p>
