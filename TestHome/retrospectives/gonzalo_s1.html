<!-- ---------------------------- External Issues ----------------------------- -->

<b>CCP</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Both Lync and Aptest are inaccessible for a number of testers.
		<li>Changes to scripts were made midway through the sprint.
		<li>DDoS Attacks continue, but mitigation efforts have improved and no attack has caused more than 10 minutes of downtime.
		<li>The mac launcher was broken on and off throughout the sprint, although it was possible to bypass the launcher, so it didn&#39;t cause any difficulties to the sprint.
	</ul></p>

<b> PTW </b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Team members being shifted to other teams caused a number of scripts to be transferred, highlighting how this process could be improved.
	</ul></p>

<!-- ---------------------------- Good Practices ----------------------------- -->

<b>Knowledge Sharing</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Information sharing amongst the team continues to go well.  
		Testers are making regular use of the calendar and using the skype channels to exchange information and help others with potential defects.  
		New team members have also received a lot of support from existing people on the team.
	</ul></p>
	
<b>Sprint</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Despite difficulties with Aptest, Laurie made an excellent job of getting scripts assigned in Aptest.  Drew&#39;s automation of FW account creation also went well, trimming at least 5.5 hours off the time spent on the FW scripts.
		<li>Thanks to the new policy of not taking over Priority 2s until the testers assigned priority 3s are completed resulted in a number of testers being able to do scripts they&#39;d never done before, increasing overall knowledge on the team.
		<li>Despite difficulties with Aptest, testers coped very well.  
		<li>The sprint was finished early, which many testers felt good about.
	</ul></p>

<div id="team_concerns" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Inernal Issues----------------------------- -->

<b> PTW </b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Team members going on holiday results in confusion and time wasted catching up to where the previous tester was up to when the new tester takes over.
	</ul></p>
	
<b>Sprint</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Sprint Tracker had had the row size adjusted, resulting in information pertaining to a required wait being hidden.
		<li>The fleet script could include a more detailed summary of the current fleet composition at each step, as it can be quite a daunting script to come into the middle of.
		<li>The scrum master sheet is inaccurate.  Grant has updated it to match the sprint tracker, however the sprint tracker script may also be inaccurate.  
		<li>It was also discussed that it may be prudent to include information on what kind of waits are required instead of simply listing how many there are (such as describing a 48 hour wait as a 48 hour reinforcement) as this would make testers more aware of what each script requires.
	</ul></p>

<!-- ---------------------------- Action Points ----------------------------- -->

<b> Holiday Transfers</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>A template will be prepared for an email that will summarize in detail the testers progress on any scripts they may need to transfer while going on holiday or to another team.  This template will be used to ensure that no matter how big or small the script being transferred over, the information the new tester needs will be in an easy to find predictable location.  It will also be sent to all team members.
	</ul></p>

<b>Additional Docs</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Drew&#39;s Outposts doc was praised highly and it was suggested that there could be other script that similar docs could be created for.
