<!-- ---------------------------- External Issues ----------------------------- -->

<b>CCP</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Testing was interrupted by the Trial Account Minitask which required 4 testers for a whole day.
		<li>A lot of testers are still lacking access to Aptest accounts.
		<li>Scott does not have access to a JIRA account.
		<li>Scott, Stewart and Iain does not have access to Lync accounts.
		<li>Launcher update issue caused an unplanned downtime. 
		<li>Various other unexplained downtimes due to server issues.
		<li>Testers do not have access to certain issues on JIRA &#45; this causes issues when searching for existing exploits, ESP issues and Launcher issues. 
	</ul></p>

<b> PTW </b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Drew was required on another project and missed the final two days of the sprint. 
		<li>Iain was required to backfill the Valkyrie team. 
		<li>Various issues with downloading patches, could possibly be related to PTW network/ Smoothwall.
	</ul></p>

</a>
<div id="good_practices" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Good Practices ----------------------------- -->

<b>Team Communication</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The team did a great job of supporting the new testers with knowledge, training and advice.
		<li>Drew made good use of the handover mail which enabled Laurie to quickly pick us his scripts.
		<li>The team made good use of the team calendar to record waits and downtimes. 
		<li>The team did a good job of sharing patches, patching was sometimes problematic but someone was always able to share it. 
		<li>The minitask team had good internal communication and worked well together.
		<li>The team handled the redistribution of the minitaskers&#39; scripts well. 
	</ul></p>
	
<b>New Testers</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The new testers produced lots of defects.
		<li>The new testers coped well with being continually shifted around different PCs.
		<li>The new testers learned team practices and processes very quickly.
	</ul></p>

<b>Sprint</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The team finished the sprint on time despite various interruptions.  
		<li>The team entered a large amount of script changes during downtimes &#45; we had 280 pending changes before sprint, the team decreased this to 129 during the sprint.
		<li>The automation of the FW accounts saved a lot of time.
		<li>The FW tracker was a huge success and improved the running of the FW scripts.
	</ul></p>
	
<b>Team as a whole</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The team did well to cover the senior role while Drew unavailable.
		<li>The team&#39;s overall script knowledge is improving. 
		<li>The team has found its pace with the new release schedule, most testers enjoy the mix of sprints and minitasks. 
	</ul></p>

<div class="expandable_content_header">Internal Issues</div>
</a>
<div id="team_concerns" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Internal Issues----------------------------- -->

<b> New Testers </b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>New testers&#39; script times were not as fast as experienced testers &#45; <b>this is to be expected and cannot be helped.</b>
		<li>New testers&#39; continual shifting around means a lot of time is spent setting up on new PCs. 
	</ul></p>
	
<b>Scripts</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The team feel that a few scripts are poorly written and slow testing down
		<ul>
			<li>Capital Ships
			<li>Rigs and Invention 
		</ul>
		<li>The team feel that some scripts took longer than usual due to large defects
		</ul>
			<li>Incursions
			<li>Exploration Dungeons
		</ul>
		<li>There is some concern over the catchment of the testcases &#45; testers feel they are sometimes unable to fail testcases due to the wording of the testcase.

	</ul></p>
	
<b>Documents and Practices</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>The handover email might need further streamlining &#45; possibly takes too long to fill in.
		<li>Testers have been forgetting to use the Q+A document.
		<li>Reporting is a complex process and ideally could be streamlined.
		<li>There have been instances of testers not reporting throughout the day &#45; this causes delays towards the reporting deadline. 
		<li>The team feel the Dom Sov script tips page could be reworked to be more readable and helpful. 
	</ul></p>
	
<b>Sprint</b>

	<ul>
		<li>The sprint took longer than usual &#45; many testers came in slower than averages. 
	</ul></p>

<b>Testing equipment</b>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Jesse and Drew&#39;s PCs continue to be hard to test on due to their low performance.
	</ul></p>

<div class="expandable_content_header">Action Points</div>
</a>
<div id="action_points" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Action Points ----------------------------- -->

<b> New Testers</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Tormod will reorganize the folders and files in the EVE Network folder to create a &#34;Starker Kit&#34; which contains all the files a new tester may need when setting up on a new PC.
	</ul></p>

<b>Sprint</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Testers have been reminded to not slow down when the sprint is making good time &#45; this might explain the slower sprint times.
	</ul></p>
	
<b>CCP</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Tormod will chase up CCP about rearranging project access on JIRA so we can access Launcher and ESP defects.
		<li>Tormod will chase up CCP about the inaccessible Aptest and Lync accounts. 
	</ul></p>

<b>Scripts</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Some scripts should be looked into editing on a larger scale due to bad flow and poor writing
		<ul>
			<li>Capital Ships
			<li>Rigs and Invention
		</ul>
	</ul></p>

<b>Documents and Practices</b>

	<ul>
		<li>The handover mail will be reviewed and potentially reworked &#45; this may be delayed until it has been used more times by more of the team.
		<li>Testers have been reminded to use the Q+A doc whenever information is received from CCP.
		<li>Testers have been reminded to report defects during the day &#45; not leave it to the last hour. 
		<li>Testers have been encouraged to come forward with ideas for streamlining the reporting process. 
		<li>Laurie and Stef will look into reworking the Dom Sov script tips to make them more readable. 
		<li>The team was introduced to the &#34;Func Updates&#34; page of the Change Request document and encouraged to add notes about new functionality.
