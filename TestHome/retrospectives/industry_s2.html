<!-- ---------------------------- External Issues ----------------------------- -->

<b>
CCP
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>CCP had two bank holidays meaning they were unavailable to answer queries delaying script progress.
<li>The Mismatch_Cost error for Industry blocked scripts and caused delays.
</ul>

</p><b>
Testing Servers
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The sprint started on Pulsar which is an unstable testing environment and caused issues with sphinx and forming fleets. 
<li>The main server changed from Pulsar to Singularity mid sprint.
<li>Server Downtime took time away from testers.
</ul>

</a>
<div id="good_practices" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Good Practices ----------------------------- -->

<b>
Information Sharing
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The team is making good use of the calendar and helping each other with script waits.
<li>The team has implemented more script changes and started adding new test steps to increase coverage of new EVE functionality.
</ul>

</p><b>
Sprint
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The team finished the sprint early despite holidays and interruptions.
<li>The team has entered a high number of defects this sprint.
</ul>

</p><b>
Testing Knowledge
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The team is improving their EVE knowledge and testers are taking ownership of their own script coverage.
</ul>


<!-- ---------------------------- Good Practices ----------------------------- -->
</div>

<a href="#" onclick="hideshow(team_concerns)">
<div class="expandable_content_header">Internal Issues</div>
</a>
<div id="team_concerns" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Internal Issues ----------------------------- -->

<b>
Information Sharing
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>There are team concerns about how much information is shared about the sprint progress and how this affects testing times and tester motivation.
</ul>

</p><b>
Scripts
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>New scripts lack information meaning testers have to figure out the new intended functionality or contact CCP for confirmation.
</ul>

</p><b>
Script changes
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Testers are unclear on which script changes need to go through the skype channel and which can be implemented immediately.
<li>There are concerns about multiple testers trying to implement changes at the same time.
</ul>

</p><b>
Scrum
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The team are concerned that the "Concerns within the team" section of the sprint retrospective may not be appropriately named potentially causing us miss talking about some relevant issues.
</ul>

</p><b>
Sprint
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The team took on average an extra 4 hours per tester to complete the sprint. This can partly be accounted for by Pulsar, new industry features and several known issues.
</ul>

</p><b> 
Testing equipment
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Grant had an issue with his 2nd HD not freeing up space when items were deleted. This caused will cause delays in the future if not fixed. 
<li>Roman had issues with corrupt files on his PC. 
<li>Drews PC is slow being close to minimum spec making it difficult to run several clients and carry out admin tasks. 
<li>Many testers are struggling to run 3 clients simultaneously.
</ul>

<a href="#" onclick="hideshow(action_points)">
<div class="expandable_content_header">Action Points</div>
</a>
<div id="action_points" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Action Points ----------------------------- -->

<b>
Information Sharing
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The team decided more information may be useful and suggested that the scrum master should give a rundown of how many scripts are Not Started/ In Progress by priority.
</ul>
 
 </p><b>
Scripts
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Tormod will ask CCP if they can send us extra information when giving us new scripts such as a list of defects already affecting the script and more context of the intended functionality. 
<li>Tormod will be disseminating information from the EVE dev blogs so the team has a reference of the intended functionality for the new scripts. 
 </ul>
 
</p><b>
Script Changes
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Only outdated terminology, values and spelling errors that are confirmed by a CCP source can be immediately implement.
<li>Only one script change should be posted and then confirmed in the script change channel at a time.
<li>The change request document can be temporarily shared when there are a lot of script changes. Testers will make sure to claim cells for their changes saving before and after to minimize accidental overwrites. 
</ul>

</p><b>
Scrum
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The "Concerns within the team" section will be renamed to "Internal Issue" as this is a broader term. 
</ul>

</p><b>
Testing Equipment
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Drew could be given an additional PC for admin work. 
<li>Roman has already been given a new PC to resolve his issue. 
<li>Grant has already formatted his 2nd HD to resolve his issue. 
<li>Tormod will ask about the possibility of laptop testing. 
<li>Tormod will contact Dave about the feasibility of adding extra RAM to testers PCs.
</ul>
