<div id="action_points" class="show"></p>
<!-- ---------------------------- Action Points ----------------------------- -->

		<li>Confluence access will be pushed for.
		<li>Testrail Demo&#39;s during exploratory.
		<li>Lync and Aptest accounts for Backfill
	</ul></p>

<b>Sprint</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>When taking over another testers script mid sprint, the new tester should be listed as supporting tester.
		<li>When using aptest, a defect entered against a test step should be entered in the notes as well as the defectID section.
	</ul></p>
	
<b>Documents and Practices</b></p>

	<ul>
		<li>A shared space will be created for the FW and Outposts trackers for each sprint, to make it easier for testers to take over those scripts if necessary.
		<li>If preparing the DSR for the day, the reporter should check the personal pages on the tracker to make sure it is correct.
		<li>If a script has been started by another tester and is being taken over by you, you should be listed as supporting tester.
		<li>Test Home should be updated
		<li>The documentation folder should be tidied up.
		<li>All backfill testers should be made clear on these changes.
		<li>When experiencing difficulties with Skype, clearing the cache may resolve the issue, though this should only be done when absolutely necessary as keeping a log is important.
