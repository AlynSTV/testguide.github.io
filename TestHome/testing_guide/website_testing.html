<h4>Website Testing </h4>
Website testing is best performed on Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox as both have powerful and versatile tools that will enable you to provide more information about the defect you find – namely the <b>inspect element</b> tool. On both browsers, this will enable you to see the coding and styles for the page in question. Simply right-click on the affected area of the webpage and select “inspect element” – a separate panel will then open up containing the page code and related styles. Selecting the various elements in the code will then highlight that element on the webpage. Using this can help you identify the class or ID of the affected area. You may also be able to understand the values that are causing the issue – this can enable you to write a more detailed defect report. </p>

<h4> Screenshots </h4>
You’ll also want to have a screen capture extension installed on your main testing browser - for example 
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/screen-capture-by-google/cpngackimfmofbokmjmljamhdncknpmg?hl=en" target="_blank">Screen Capture by Google for Chrome</a>. This will allow you to capture entire page screenshots – should you require them. Sometimes however, it’ll be prudent to capture a screenshot manually - for example when you need to include the address bar in the screenshot or when you wish to include the extra information that you find when inspecting the element. </p>

As with most defect reports, screenshots be as clear as possible – in terms of quality and displaying the issue. Therefore always save your screenshot as a <b>PNG</b> and properly annotate it. If the defect is affecting a specific <b>span</b> or <b>div</b> on the webpage, make use of the inspect element tools when taking your screenshot as these can clearly highlight the issue as well as displaying the relevant element name/style and dimensions - along with associated style information. </p>

<li>Properly annotated</li>
<li>Address bar when relevant</li>
<li>Inspect element screenshot detailing code/style - when relevant</li>


</ul>

<h4>Website Defect Report </h4>

When writing up your defect report, include a weblink to an affected page - if applicable. If there is a page that doesn’t have the issue, you may wish to include a link to that page for comparison. Likewise, feel free to use weblinks in your reproduction steps – but only to supplement your steps, as you should ensure that your steps follow standard procedure.  </p>

Each defect report should include:</p>

<ul>

<li> Browsers tested including version number: </br></li>
		<ul><li><b>Reproducible on [Browser] – [Version Number]</b> </li></ul>
<li> Description of the defect </li>
<li> A link to the affected page - if relevant </li>
<li> Expected result/Link to unaffected page - if relvant</li>
<li> Full reproduction steps with example links </li>


</ul>

is relevant to your defect report on JIRA. </span> </p>
