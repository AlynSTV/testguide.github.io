<h4>Writing a Defect</h4>

Any defect created should include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>A short descriptive title </li>
<li>Information on where the bug was found/reproduced: server, build, code branch </li>
<li>An accurate description of what the bug is  </li>
<li>A fully accurate and precise set of reproduction steps  </li>
<li>A logserver file of the bug occurring. Even if the defect isn't showing anything in log server, or even if it is an English Language defect, you should always include a log file - it's good practice.</li>
<li>In-game screenshots/video of the bug - always in high quality <b>PNG</b> format and annotated appropriately</li>
</ul>
<a id="checklist"/>

<h4>Defect Template </h4>

<b>Title: </b> </p>
Outpost: Station Management button disappears</p>

<span class="keypoint"> Descriptive, concise, and unique.  Should contain searchable words, an 
appropriate prefix and should, effectively, explain the defect at a glance. </span></p>

<b>Description:</b> </p>
Reproducible on Singularity, EVE-2014-ARTHUR, 435082 (5/5) </br>
Reproducible on Chaos, EVE-2014-ARTHUR, 436082 (3/3) </br>
Non-Reproducible on Multiplicity, EVE-TRANQUILITY, 412710 (0/3) [Feature Not Present] </p>

<span class="keypoint"> Should always contain server information in the above format - commas and all.  Server, branch and 
build number are necessary, as is a reproduction rate.  Repro rate should be a minimum of 3 
attempts unless the defect is a text error. In the case of non-reproducible defects, you will observe that the repro rate is (0/3) indicating that you attempted to reproduce it 3 times, but the defect wasn’t seen at all. Non-repros should always follow this format.</span></p>

<span class="keypoint"><b>Note the optional [ Feature Not Present ] for when servers do not have a new feature</b> - Still be sure the repro on that server as best you can with the current system.</span></p>

Character: ptw Maverick</br>
http://87.237.38.24:50001/gm/character.py?action=Character&characterID=94604159</p>

<span class="keypoint">Always include the character name for a character that repro'd the issue and the relevant ESP page for that character on the primary test server. If, in the case, the defect is not seen on a character (e.g. on the Character Selection Screen - include the <span class="red">User Name</span> 
and relevant ESP link.</span></p>

When a player owns an outpost, they should be able to access station management. However, it was observed that if a player logs out of the server then back in, they will no longer have the "Station mgmt" button until they enter space then dock again.</p>

</p>

<span class="keypoint"> Description should be clear and explain the circumstances surrounding the issue.  The report should talk of “the player” and the defect should be shown as “it was observed”. Your report should not be overly 
verbose, but should definitively cover the defect.</span></p>

[<u><a href="defects.html#graphics">RES file paths</a></u>] - <b>If applicable</b></br>
[<u><a href="logserver.html">Exception Thrown In Log Server</a></u>]  -<b> If applicable </b>(remember to remove the timestamps for clarity).

</p>

<b>Expected Result:</b></p>
The station management button should always be accessible to whoever has the outpost.</p>


<span class="keypoint"> <b>An expected result is not always needed</b>.  For instance “The game should not crash” is 
unnecessary.  Use best judgement here and think about it from the POV of someone who may not 
be so EVE experienced.</span></p>

<b>Attached Files:</b></p>
* Screenshot  Attached</br>
* Video Attached</br>
* Log Sever File Attached</br>
* DxDiag Attached</br>
</p>

<span class="keypoint">You should always list the files attached to the defect.  
All defects should at
 least contain a <b>DxDiag</b> and a <b>Log Server File.</b></span></p>

[entered by ptw]</p>

<span class=”keypoint”> Finally, your report should always end with this tag showing that it was entered by PTW. </span></p>

<b>Steps to reproduce:</b></p>
Prerequisites:</br>
1. Make sure you have a player who is the CEO of a corp.</br>
2. Find a 0.0 system that has a station. </p>

<span class="keypoint"> Prerequisites should cover the setup that the user needs to be in an environment to make the 
defect occur, but should not feature the actual steps to make the defect occur.  Sometimes they are not necessary and therefore do not need to be included.</span></p>

Steps to Reproduce:</br>
1. Create a Test Territorial Claim Unit using /load me "test terr".</br>
2. Right click on the TCU and select “Launch For Corp”. </br>
3. Anchor the TCU then put online. </br>
4. Using a ship with high DPS like a Phoenix with Citadel torpedo launchers, lock and fire at the station until shield, armor and structure have depleted. </br>
5. Once the outpost has been claimed by the player corp, proceed to dock then log off the server. </br>
6. Log back on and observe that the "Station mgmt" tab is no longer there (located on the bottom right of the station information UI). </br>
7. Enter space then dock back again </br>
8. Observe the station management button has reappeared. </p>

<span class="keypoint"> One step to one line.  If slash commands are suggested they should be added to the 
end of the step, not comprise the entire step.  Formatting and punctuation are important!  Steps should 
usually start with a verb and the final step should always be the defect occurring (99% of the time 
this will start with “Observe”). <b>Note: If you have included prerequisites then the title “Steps to Reproduce:” should be included.</b> If there are no pre-reqs then you can forgo including the title "Steps to repro..."</span></p>

<b>Computer:</b></p>
Windows XP Professional (5.1, Build 2600) </br>
ATI Radeon HD 5700 Series</br>
Driver:6.14.0010.7140 (English) </br>
</p>


<span class="keypoint">This should include basic information on the machine that the defect was discovered on.
  OS + version, GFX card + driver is normally enough – this information can be found in your DxDiag. If, in the case of some graphics issues, you may be required to include the basic computer info of another computer on which the defect was observed. Likewise, if you are including information about a second computer – the relevant DxDiag should be included too.</span></p>
