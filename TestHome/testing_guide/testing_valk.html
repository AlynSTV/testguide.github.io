<a id="day_structure"/>
<h4> Day-To-Day Structure </h4>

Each day consists of 8 working hours. The daily structure for EVE is as such:</p>
<b>Morning - 3.5 hours</b> </br>
15 min Stand-up in the morning</br>
15 min break at 10:00</p>

<b>Afternoon - 3.75 hours</b></br>
15 min break at 15:00</br>
</p>


<a id="daily"/>
<h4> Daily Routine </h4>
<ul>
<li>Tick Tock – check-in to tick tock and ensure your daily activities are complete</li>
<li>Skype – sign into Skype and check important test channels</li>
<li>Email – ensure you’re signed into Outlook </li>
<li>Lync/Skype for business – ensure you’re signed into Lync</li>
<li>Group Chat – open up and sign into group chat</li>
<li>HMD – it’s a good idea to remind your Lead or Senior to pass out the Oculus/PS headsets.</li>
<li>
<li>Prepare for daily Stand Up</li>
</ul>

<h5>At the end of the day</h5></p>

<ul>
<li>If going  on holiday, update your time entry activities for the days you’ll be off and get your team lead to check them before you leave</li>
<li>Shut down your computer – help protect the environment!</li>
</ul>

<a id="skype"/>
<h4> Skype </h4>

Skype is our general form of team communication - beyond talking. You'll have already been instructed to register a skype ID. Once you have done 
 so, you'll be introduced to our main skype channels. </p>
 
 <h5> Channels </h5>

<ul>

	<li>
	<b>EVE Valkyrie [Func] - </b> text </p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>EVE Valkyrie [DEFECTS] - </b> Any time you <a href="defects.html">enter a defect </a> you'll announce it in this channel using the 
	format <span class="red">(bug) - [severity] – [defectID] – [defect title]</span>.  
	The emoticons at the start of each defect line are used as visual indicators to aid with reporting. Also note that this
	 channel is strictly for defects only.</p>
	</li>


	<li>
	<b>EVE Valkyrie [BUILD CHANNEL] - </b> </p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>EVE Valkyrie [VERIFICATIONS] - </b>  </p>
	</li>

</ul>


<h5> Additional Information </h5>

One important thing to know about using Skype is <b>The Banter Line </b> if your leads feel that too much chat is occuring and not enough work 
they will post <b>------------------------------------</b> when you see this - stop! The line is also used to help leads highlight important 
information. So keep an eye out. </p>

On the <a href="eve_team.html">EVE Team</a> page you'll find all the skype IDs for the team. Clicking on the ID will start a conversation 
with them in skype. </p>

Please note that whilst you may be able to change the notifications settings on Skype Channels - please do not stop notifications from EVE 
Functionality and the Patches channel - as you may miss important information.

<!-- ---------------- LYNC ------------------------- -->

<a id="lync"/>
<h4>Lync</h4>

Lync gives us a direct line to CCP - giving us unprecedented access for outsourced testers. To log into Lync:

<ol>

<li> Lync will ask you for a sign-in address - put in you ccpgames.com address</p>
e.g. e4e.michael.read@ccpgames.com</p>

<li> Click Sign-in and wait for it to ask for a password
<li> Put in a password and sign in - wait for it to complain again
<li> Put in your sign-in details as outlined below

</ol>

<h5>Sign-in Details</h5>

<ul> 

	<li>[First Name].[Last Name]@ccpgames.com
 	<li>ccp\[First Name].[Last Name]
 	<li>Password

</ul>


<a id="good_practice"/>
<h4>Good Practices</h4>
<ul>

<li>Maintain a list of personal defects for quick reference</li>
<li>Check on the status of own defects daily</li>
<li>Save an up-to-date DxDiag each week</li>
<li>When on a public test server - always clean up after yourself (remove wrecks, cargo containers, don't leave ships
floating about in space)</li>
<li>Slash commands should only be used in the Slash Console </li>
<li>Ocassionally free up some HDD space by deleting old log server logs and screenshots</li>
<li>Save copies of entered defects with screenshots and logs - for easily offline reference </li>
<li>If you are being stymied by a script, test around it by <a href="#ubertest">UBERTEST</a>ing</li>
<li>Question Everything!</li>
<ul>
<li>When you see something odd, always investigate it. Assuming is not the same as knowing</li>
</ul>
<li>Communication is <b>KEY</b></li>
<ul>
<li>When in doubt, <b>ASK</b></li>
<li>If in doubt, <b>BUG IT</b></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h4>UBERTEST</h4>

<b>UBERTEST</b> is an acronym designed to apply to different facets of QA testing. The acronym breaks down like this:</p>

<b>U</b>sability – How easy and intuitive things are to use.</br>
<b>B</b>oundaries – Limitations, going over them or trying to.</br>
<b>E</b>quivalence Partitioning – Testing extremes and the middle, instead of all possibilities, to save time.</br>
<b>R</b>esults – Does each action result in the correct outcome.</br>
<b>T</b>ransition – Moving from one screen/state/situation to another in different ways.</br>
<b>E</b>rror Recovery – Does the program handle things well when things go wrong.</br>
<b>S</b>tress – How things scale, doing things en masse or repetitively.</br>
<b>T</b>echnical Requirements – Do things work acceptably on min specs or low settings and with bad connections etc.</p>

You should use it as a framework to apply to different situations when you are ad-hoc/exploratory 
testing. Remember, UBERTEST isn't just a set of guidelines - it's a state of mind. </p>

<a id="shortcuts"/>
<h4>Shortcuts</h4>

As you can imagine, our desktops are littered with shortcuts and files for easy access. We all have our own little 
systems, but there are a few shortcuts you'll definitely be wanting to help you in your testing ways.</p>

Obviously, the most important shortcuts are the ones to the game itself. We have multiple clients installed, each directing 
to a different <a href="servers.html">server</a> depending on their shortcut target.</p>

Useful file directory shortcuts include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	CCP Tester Access - All CCP related files on the <a href="network.html">PTW Network</a>
	</li>
	<li>
	Reporting - A direct link to the EVE Reporting folder on the network
	</li>
	<li>
	Common Files - Some testers find it helpful to have a folder with shortcuts to each Client's common.ini file, usually 
	located in <b>C:\Program Files\CCP\[Client]\common.ini</b> as these files tell you the branch and build of the client
	</li>
	<li>
	FRAPS Movies - to easily find any files you record in FRAPS
	</li>
	<li>
	Program Files CCP - where all your clients are saved on your PC
	</li>

</ul></p>

Essential programs include:</p>

<ul>

	<li>
	FRAPS - for recording videos of issues in game
	</li>
	<li>
	Windows Movie Maker - for editing aforementioned videos
	</li>

</ul>


Finally it's probably a good idea to keep your <b>DxDiag</b> on your desktop as you'll upload it to every defect. You may also 
find it useful to keep shortcuts to your own personal defect and DNA lists. A blank New Text Document can come in handy whenever 
you're entering a defect that you've written up in word -the CCP defect tracker sometimes doesn't like you copying straight from 
word, so just copy your defect text into a blank .txt file then copy from there - it's a faff but it gets the job done!
