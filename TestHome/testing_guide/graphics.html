<h4>Graphics</h4>

	There are a few things to bear in mind when you come across a graphics issue:

	<ul>
		<li>What Graphics Card you are on.
		<li>Whether or not your drivers are up-to-date.
		<li>What DX platform your client is running.
	</ul>

	You can also supply more information to CCP regarding the graphics file causing an issue by investigating the Res Filepath and Graphics ID.</p>

<a id="graphics_card"/>
<h4>Graphics Card</h4>

	Any issue you are seeing may  relate to which graphics card you a running - and whether or not your drivers are up-to-date - to help narrow down the issue, have a fellow tester check the issue on a graphics 
	card separate from your own and include any information about repro and non-repro graphics cards in your report. If you repro an issue on multiple graphics cards, it may be prudent to attach DxDiags for each 
	machine tested on.</p>

<a id="graphics_dx"/>
<h4>DX11/DX9</h4>

	EVE can currently be run in either DX9 or DX11, <span class="red">your graphics issue may relate to which version of DirectX your client is running on</span>. Switching DX is straightforward - just use the settings 
	option on the launcher, navigate to the DirectX tab and then switch DX. </p>

	You can also force the client to load in your chosen DX by modifying your shortcut - this is especially useful when using a by-pass to access a server.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>/triPlatform=dx9
	</ul>

	Just add this switch to the shortcut after the server switch and change dx accordingly.</p>

	In game, to monitor which version of DirectX you are running, navigate to:
 
	<ul>
		<li>Insider > Tools > Turn FPS Monitor ON
	</ul>

	</a> </p>

<h4> Res Filepath and Graphics ID</h4>

	When defecting graphics issues concerning graphics (textures/ polygons/ z-fighting), you should include the res filepath and the Graphics ID (GID) in the description. </p>

	To do this, right click the asset in space > GM/ > res > click on the filepath to copy it to the clipboard, you will also find the GID above this. 
	Adding this information will help CCP identify the issue more efficiently. </p>

	The filepath will look something like this: </p>

	<span class="keypoint">res:/dx9/model/station/caldari/cs1/cs1.red</span></p>

	<a href="../images/graphics/res_path.png" target="_blank">
	<image src="../images/graphics/res_path.png" class="contentimage"/>
	</a> </p>

<h5> Including the Base Model </h5>

	When defecting an issue present on all instances of a model, it is useful to include the base model in the title which can be found as part of the res filepath. This tells CCP that all objects with this base model are affected. </p>

	For example if you found an issue with the Sebiestor station below and you find this issue on all variants of the same station model you would include the base model MS4. </p>

	<a href="../images/graphics/res_structure.png" target="_blank">
	<image src="../images/graphics/res_structure.png" class="contentimage"/>
	</a> </p>

	Under the CCP naming convention MS4 stands for Minmatar Station 4. So even though the faction of the station is Sebiestor the base model is Minmatar.  </p>

<a id="graphics_openfailed"/>
<h4> Open Failed Error </h4>

	While testing you may come across an open failed error in the log. </p>

	<span class="keypoint"> Open failed on "F:/Program Files/CCP/Singularity/res/dx9/model/Battlestation/Angel_s/Small_Angel_Station_tex_d.dds" </span> </p>

	The above suggests that a graphics file has not opened correctly in-game. This is normally due to the file changing location and the filepath not being updated in the code. 
	When you see this in the log you should look at the file path and try to find the object in game to see if there are issues. In the example below the texture files are missing from the model.</p> 

	<a href="../images/graphics/open_failed.png" target="_blank">
	<image src="../images/graphics/open_failed.png" class="contentimage"/>
	</a> </p>

	If you find an open failed error and are unable to find the object in game, you should still ping someone from CCP as they may be able to give more information on where to find the object or ask you to defect the error.</p>

<a id="graphics_miniballs"/>
<h4>Miniballs</h4>

Unless on a special task from CCP, a miniball defect may be entered only if one or more of the following criteria are met:</p>

<ol>
<li>The miniball is not in contact with any geometry of the associated asset.
<li>Any ship becomes stuck on an asset in a replicable manner, and the miniballs are clearly at fault.
<li>An exception in the log in some way identifies miniball data as erroneous or missing.
</ol>

	<h5>Miniballs and Radius:</h5> </p> 

		The Radius of an object dictates its presence in space and its boundary tells the players how far from said object the players is and prevents the players from flying into it.
		A miniball is a destiny collision bubble that will over write the collision of the radius. </p>

		Sometimes destiny and mini-balls are not implemented correctly or become outdated as assets are updated.
		When this happens collision can fail and the player's ships can bump into empty space or even pass through the object. </p> 

	<h5> View miniballs and destiny balls: </h5> </p>
	
		You can access GM options relating to balls & boxes by right clicking on the model > selecting GM > selecting Ball & Boxes.</p>
		To view mini-balls select "Show Miniball Runtime Data."</p>
		To view destiny balls select "Wireframe Destiny Ball."</p>
	
		<a href="../images/graphics/view_mini_ball.png" target="_blank">
		<image src="../images/graphics/view_mini_ball.png" class="contentimage"/>
		</a> </p>	
	
	<h5> Examples of Good Placement: </h5></p>
	
		<a href="../images/graphics/good_ball.png" target="_blank">
		<image src="../images/graphics/good_ball.png" class="contentimage"/>
		</a> </p>

		This is how it should look, 
		the miniballs are covering the object with no gaps where the player could get stuck and no huge amounts of empty space taken up by the mini-balls. </p>
	
		<a href="../images/graphics/good_ball_2.png" target="_blank">
		<image src="../images/graphics/good_ball_2.png" class="contentimage"/>
		</a> </p>
	
		Here you can see some of the graphic sticking out of the miniballs, 
		this is OK in most cases to minimize the amount of miniballs (especially with smaller objects). </p>
		
		<a href="../images/graphics/good_ball_3.png" target="_blank">
		<image src="../images/graphics/good_ball_3.png" class="contentimage"/>
		</a> </p>
		
		This object is small and douse not need miniballs and there for the radius (wireframe destiny ball) starts doing the job. 
		Once again the graphic stands out and that is fine to achieve the minimum amount of miniballs being used. 
		Some larger objects have a rather round shape and therefore the same rule applies. </p>
	
	<h5> Examples of Bad Placement: </h5></p>

		<a href="../images/graphics/bad_ball1.png" target="_blank">
		<image src="../images/graphics/bad_ball1.png" class="contentimage"/>
		</a> </p>
		
		Here the miniball is not covering the structure and the player will be able to both go through the structure and bump into empty space. </p>
		
		<a href="../images/graphics/bad_ball2.png" target="_blank">
		<image src="../images/graphics/bad_ball2.png" class="contentimage"/>
		</a> </p>
		
		Here the miniball is too big and players will bump into empty space.
		There is also an unneeded miniball inside the other and therefore not meeting the minimum number of miniballs goal. </p>
		
		<a href="../images/graphics/bad_ball_3.png" target="_blank">
		<image src="../images/graphics/bad_ball_3.png" class="contentimage"/>
		</a> </p>
		
		Here the radius is too big and players will bump empty space. </p>
		
		These are extreme examples to show how wrong mini-ball placement can go.
		Testers should use their own judgement on how adequatly the object is covered and whether there are gaps where players could get stuck.</p>
