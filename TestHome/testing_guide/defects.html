<h4> Defect Procedure </h4>

<ol>
<li>Ask the team/<a href="#searching">search JIRA</a> to see if it is a known issue - in some cases you may be required to check with
the CCP internal QA team</li>
<li>Reproduce the defect on the test server 5 times [this would be a good time to get a fresh log sever file/screenshot/video if required] </li>
<li>Reproduce the defect on the given repro servers [3 times on each should do] </li>
<li>Write up your <a href="writing_reports.html">defect report</a></li>
<li>Annotate any screenshots/Compress any videos - <span class="keypoint"><B>ensure file names are clear and professional as they are maintained once uploaded to JIRA</b></span></li>
<li>Submit report to CCP through JIRA - uploading all relevant files e.g. log server, DxDiag, Screenshots and Videos</li>
<li>Enter defect details into the Skype Defect Channel (bug) [Severity] – [Defect ID#] – [Defect Title] </li>
<li>Report the defect in the correct places, read the next section for a guide on this</li>
</ol>


<a id="reporting"/>
<h4> Reporting a Defect </h4>

So, you've found a defect on sprint, eh? After following the above procedure you'll have to report the defect in the correct places in our PTW 
documents.</p>

Generally you should follow this flowchart:</p>
<a href="../images/defects/fail_script.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/fail_script.png" class="contentimage"/></a>


<a id="finding"/></p>

The only part of this check which should cause an issue is the "Is it a defect with the core func of the script?"
This is quite a fudgey term and has a fair bit of "grey area". The general question here is "What is the script testing?". </p>

For example:
</p>
You're running a "Sound" script and the testcase is as follows:<br>
<b><i></br>
Procedure:</br>
Activate the module.</p>

Verification:</br>
The module should activate and the activation SFX should be heard.</p>
</i></b>

Your Defect:</br>
The module does not activate.</p>

This defect fails a testcase. But as it is regarding the activation of a module and not a sound effect, it does not fail the script.
If you need any clarification on this procedure, ask the team or your lead.</p>

So after using the flowchart you'll find yourself with one of these three outcomes:

<ul>
	<li>Exploratory Defect</li>
	<li>Against Script Defect</li>
	<li>Failing Defect</li>
</ul>

The following sections will detail how each of these defect types and how to report them. 

<h5> Exploratory Defect </h5>
If a defect doesn't fail a testcase, it is entered as "Exploratory". 
These defects are not entered into the Sprint Tracker. 
They are recorded in the Rep Doc in the following way:</p>
<a href="../images/defects/exp_defect.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/exp_defect.png" class="contentimage"/></a>

<h5> Against Script Defect </h5>
If a defect fails a test case but isn't an A or B or concerning the "Core Functionality" of the script then it is
"Against Script". </br>
It is reported in both the Script Tracker and the Rep Doc. In the Tracker they are reported in the "Against Script" 
column and the script is still marked as a pass (when it's finished): </p>
<a href="../images/defects/against_defect.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/against_defect.png" class="contentimage"/></a></p>

In the Red Doc it is reported against the script on the day it was entered in the following way:</p>
<a href="../images/defects/against_defect_rep.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/against_defect_rep.png" class="contentimage"/></a></p>

On the next day, as the script is still in progress but as the defect 
was not entered today, we remove the Severity but keep it against the script:</p>
<a href="../images/defects/against_defect_rep2.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/against_defect_rep2.png" class="contentimage"/></a></p>

<h5> Failing Defect </h5>
If a defect fails a test case and it is an A or a B then it automatically fails the script. It also fails the script if it 
is a defect with the "Core Functionality" of the script being ran (please refer to the above section for details on how best to deal with this).
A "Failing Defect" is reported in both the Sprint Tracker and the Rep Doc. The defect ID is placed in the "Fails Script" column and the script is marked as a fail (when it's finished):</p>
<a href="../images/defects/failing_defect.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/failing_defect.png" class="contentimage"/></a></p>

In the Rep Doc it is entered in the same way as an "Against Script Defect" except we put a "Y" in the "Fails Script" column:</p>
<a href="../images/defects/failing_defect_rep.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/failing_defect_rep.png" class="contentimage"/></a></p>

If the failing defect is new and has been that day then it is entered with a severity and a "Y" in the "Fails Script" column:</p>
<a href="../images/defects/failing_defect_rep2.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/failing_defect_rep2.png" class="contentimage"/></a></p>
<h4> Recording Evidence </h4>

When you find a defect, or even if you are unsure as to whether or not something is a defect, it is good practice to save the current log file and take a screenshot (where possible). </p>

<ul>
<li>To take a screenshot in game, simply have focus on the EVE client and press PrintScreen. This will save a screenshot
 in the following location - C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\My Documents\EVE\capture\Screenshots <b> 
(Note that the client will save all screenshots in high quality. This PNG format should always be preserved when annotating )</b></li> </p>



<li>To save your log sever file, simply have focus on log server and press <b>Ctrl+Shift+S</b>. This will save your current log in the LogSever folder – wherever the application is saved on your machine. For a guide on 
how to effectively use Log Server, click <a href="logserver.html">here.</a> </li>
</ul>

<a id="screenshots"/>

<h4>Annotating Screenshots</h4>	

A properly annotated screenshot can sometimes be more useful than the best defect report so long as they are constructed 
properly. </p>

Whenever we include screenshots in a defect report, you should always make sure that the issue is clear - to do this, we 
often edit the image using highly specialised photo-editing programed named <b>Microsoft Paint</b> (it gets the job done!)
 Highlight the area with a red box and include text explaining the defect in brief. You may also wish to consider composite
 images containing extra screenshots detailing the progression of the defect or even how something should look based 
on a previous working build. Sometimes that's not possible so multiple screenshots are just as good. At the end of 
the day - the more information 
the better.</p>

<b>Remember when editing your image to ensure that it is saved as a high quality PNG file</b></p>

<a href="../images/defects/screenshot1.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/screenshot1.png" class="contentimage"/>
</a></p>

<a href="../images/defects/screenshot2.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/screenshot2.png" class="contentimage"/>
</a></p>

<a id="videos"/>

<h4>Videos</h4>	

Sometimes, a static image can't display the issue you find and only a video will do. In this case, we capture a video in game
using <b>FRAPS.</b> You should have already been directed to install FRAPs on your computer. If not, you should find an install
 file in the CCP folder on the PTW Network - just ask your team lead! </p>

When capturing a video, make sure it is clear and to the point. We only use an unregistered version of FRAPS so length should 
never be an issue (you can only record 30secs at a time.) If you have to, you can always record more than 1 video and edit them
 together.</p>

To record with FRAPS simply:

<ol>
<li>Launch FRAPS</li>
<li>Launch the EVE Client</li>
<li>Prepare to reproduce your defect (it may also help to resize your client so that it is square rather than widescreen)</li>
<li>Press the FRAPS Hotkey to begin recording (F9 is the default)</li>
<li>Reproduce the defect</li>
<li>Press the hotkey again to finish recording</li>
</ol>

Once you have recorded your defect with FRAPS you'll need to compress so that it's a manageable size to upload with your 
report. To do this, simply import the video into <b>Windows Movie Maker</b> and save the movie file as a <b>.mp4</b>
The .mp4 is the preferred format as the video can be played directly from the webpage.
Should you need, you could also add any subtitles to the video to clearer explain what is happening, or even slow 
it down to highlight any issues that happen at speed.</p>

<a id="graphics"/>

<h4>Graphical Issues</h4>

If you come across a graphical issue, there are a great deal of variables to take into consideration - ranging from what machine you're using to which model is being used in game. There is such a wealth of information 
relating to graphical issues that you should refer to the <a href="graphics.html">Graphical Issues</a> page to a comprehensive look at variables to consider when investigating and writing up your report.</p>

<a id="crashes"/>
<h4>Crashes</h4>

Defecting a crash is much the same as any other defect, with just slightly more evidence required - the <span class="red">dmp file</span>. If you are reporting a crash, you will need to include this crash dump with your report (note that there are occasions when a crash dump will not be produced).</p>

If your crash does produce a dmp file, it's location will be stated in the final line of your log server log, the location of it should be in your application data:</p>

<b>C:\Documents and Settings\dspencer\Local Settings\Application Data\CCP\EVE</b> </br>

<b>16ef0040-64b5-43a8-a492-889dab4bf1fc.dmp</b></p>

The log server report will also tell you the name of the associated dmp file. This dmp file should be attached to your defect, in the same way that you would attach any file. </p>

Screenshots are also useful to provide - just press <b>Print Scrn</b> to capture your entire desktop and then edit your screenshot in paint. <span class="keypoint">Note that because the applicaiton has 
crashed, the screenshot will be saved to your PC clipboard rather than being saved in the EVE folder in My Documents.</p></span>

</a></p>

<a id="exploits"/>
<h4>Exploits</h4>

If you find an <span class="red">exploit</span>, the most important thing is to remember to set it as "<span class="red">Non Public</span>" in JIRA. To do this, when you are entering your defect, navigate to the <b>More</b> tab 
during your defect report creation, then select the Security Level as <span class="red">Non Public</span>.</p>

You should also <b>include the prefix</b> <span class="red">Exploit:</span> in the title of your issue.</p>

<a href="../images/defects/non_public.png" target="_blank">
<img src="../images/defects/non_public.png" class="contentimage"/>
</a></p>

<a id="language"/>
<h4>US Language Defects</h4>

If your defect is a language one, then you have to use the US English Skype channel. This is to ensure that when we present a suggested change to 
CCP, we are giving them an accurate and considered fix.</p>

<h5>What the Language Chat is For</h5>

The language chats on Skype are a peer-review quality control procedure, designed to pool everyone's skills and experience across every language in order to prevent mistakes being introduced into games in our Expected Results. Every tester from each language must use them any time a text change is being made - whether for a bug in an existing text, or when providing translations or making changes directly into a textfile/XTM. The person bugging must post every text change they want to make into the chat and wait for approval before submitting the change to the database XTM; the people reviewing in the language chats must carefully read the Expected Result, double check any language doubts, ask for extra context if needed, and point out any errors. The reviewer should only approve the text when they are satisfied that the text is error-free to their knowledge. </p>

<h5>What the Language Chat is Not For</h5>

The reviewer should only approve the text when they are satisfied that the text is error-free to their knowledge. </p>

<h5>How to Use the Chat</h5>

<ul>
<li>Write the Expected Result you want to propose in a Word doc with the appropriate settings.
<li>Double check any language issues you are not sure of using reliable sources.
<li>Once you think your text is correct, paste into your language chat:
<ul>
<li>The Actual Result (incorrect version)
<li>The Expected Result (your version)
<li>Any context necessary (keep it concise)
</ul>
<li>Wait for your colleagues to review your Expected Result
<li>If you get a thumb up, copy-paste your Expected Result - just as it is - into the defect report
<li>Double-check to make sure no copy-paste errors have occurred (eg you do not accidentally copy-paste part of the Skype conversation as well)
<li>If someone points out a mistake, everyone in the language chat should discuss it as far as necessary until a satisfactory correction is proposed. 
</ul>

</a> </p>

<h5>Rules</h5>

<li>The language chats must be used by all testers, for any text change you want to make.
<li>Only use the thumb up icon (y) to show approval
<li>Only use the thumb up when you are satisfied that the text is correct
<li>Always use 'correct' language in the language chats; never use slang or shortened forms (eg 'l8er' instead of 'later' etc)
<li>You must post the Expected Results exactly as they will appear - always use the correct accents, capitalisation, punctuation, codes etc exactly as they will appear in your defect report
