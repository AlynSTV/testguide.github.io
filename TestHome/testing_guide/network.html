<h4>PTW Network</h4>

All the information and documentation you’ll need (including these webpages) 
can be found on the Pole to Win internal network. </p>

As a tester, you will have access to ‘Tester Access’ on \\uk-fs2. To access this folder 
just direct your windows explorer to - \\Uk-fs2\tester_access\ </p>

As you will observe, there are various folders relating to other testing projects – normally 
organised by client name. Working on EVE Online, your primarily client folder will therefore be CCP.</p>

<a id="ptw_ccp"/>
<h4>CCP Folder </h4>

The CCP folder contains all the documentation for all CCP projects in the office. 
Here we organise cross-project data such as account access to EVE Online, tester pc data and birthdays. 
It also contains information on the personal gaming accounts of your fellow CCP team members, 
should you wish to add them as a friend on Xbox Live. </p>

<h5>Software</h5>

There is also a folder containing selected programs that you'll need to install on your PC. These include: </p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Logserver</b> - the most essential testing tool. It'll tell you when something is going wrong with the game
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Lync Client</b> - for communicating with CCP
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Skype</b> - for communicating within the office
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>FRAPS</b> - for recording videos in game
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>VLC</b> - Super useful video player
	</li>


</ul>

<h4>CCP\\EVE Folder</h4>

This is your home for all things EVE related.</p>

The most important folder here is the reporting folder. This folder you will visit many times a day as it is 
here that we track your work progress each day, make an internal record of defects entered and track the team’s 
progression on a sprint. You’ll definitely want to have a shortcut to this folder on your desktop.</p>

The key excel documents are:</p>

<b> [sprint name]_rep_doc</b> – this document must be filled in every day so that we can monitor the work done 
by each tester.</p>

	<a href="../images/network/rep_doc.png" target=“_blank”>
	<img src="../images/network/rep_doc.png" class="contentimage"/>
	</a></p>

<b> [sprint name]_sprint</b> – this file will change dynamically, based on the task at hand. 
Here you’ll be informed of the scripts assigned to you. You’ll also be required to fill out your progress 
on your scripts during the sprint (in progress/complete/blocked) and record any information that could 
be useful to other testers should they take on your work due to any absence. </p>

	<a href="../images/network/sprint_tracker.png" target=“_blank”>
	<img src="../images/network/sprint_tracker.png" class="contentimage"/>
	</a></p>


Each tester has an individual tab in the tracker. Selecting this tab will show, at a glance, which scripts
you have been assigned.</p>

	<a href="../images/network/assigned.png" target=“_blank”>
	<img src="../images/network/assigned.png" class="contentimage"/>
	</a></p>


<b> [sprint name]_prefs </b>– this is the script preference document. Before the start of 
each sprint you’ll be able to ‘Want’ [up to 10] and ‘Veto’ [up to 5] scripts. This helps ensure that 
you’re not stuck with the same scripts every sprint and aids the team lead in assigning script – and 
although the lead will attempt to give you the scripts that you want, this sometimes isn’t 
possible.<b> Note – this file is only available before the start of a sprint so may not be visible at time of reading.</b></p> 


	<a href="../images/network/pref_doc.png" target=“_blank”>
	<img src="../images/network/pref_doc.png" class="contentimage"/>
	</a></p>

<h4>EVE\\EVE Documentation</h4>

The EVE Documentation folder contains a variety of CCP and PTW constructed documents containing a variety of
information to help you in your testing ways. </p>

The EVE documentation folder is often updated with handy new files. If we receive a document from CCP detailing
a new feature - it'll most likely be here. Testers will also, from time to time, create their own useful EVE testing
documents - placing them here for the whole team. For example, here you can find a comprehensive list of implants & hardwiring,
 alongside a list of all agents available in game. </p>

<a id="ptw_eve_tool"/>
<h4>EVE\\Tools</h4>

Here you will find a selection of Tools that may help your testing. Currently, you will find a Tech 3 ship DNA constructor
and a <a href="http://eve.battleclinic.com/" target="_blank">Battle Clinic </a> to DNA program. As well as the ever useful 
<b>KILL EVE</b>.<p/> 

If the team come across, or 
create a tool - they'll put it here for everyone to use.

<a id="ptw_users"/>
<h4>\\uk-fs1\Users</h4>

When switching between computers, or even to just have a back up of your important work files - use the network. Each tester has their own folder located on 
<b>uk-fs1</b> for them to store files.
